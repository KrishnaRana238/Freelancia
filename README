                                                        Steps to run this project

1. Download the folder as ZIP
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and open it in VS Code
3. Open terminal in the root folder (i.e SIH), use the commands as:
        cd frontend
        npm i
        cd ..
        cd backend
        npm i

Executing these commands will automatically download all the dependencies, for both frontend and backend, required to run the project.

Frontend and Backend runs on two different servers.
I have added frontend

To run the Frontend React setup:
    You should be inside the "frontend" folder, once you are there run the command as:
        npm start
This will start the Frontend React setup and you will be able to view the page in the broswer at http://localhost:3000


Now since the backend server runs on another port, you will have to open new terminal. Change the directory to "backend", once you are there run the command as:
        npm start
This will start the backend server at https://localhost:8080

The server will not work if you don't have mongodb in your system. You will need to install mongodb first.
Also, you will have to configure a .env file with the content in it as:

DB_URL = "mongodb://localhost/Freelancia"
PORT = "8080"
secret = "SmartIndia"
gmailID = "Your gmail account"
appPassword = "Your app password for gmail account"
